                <p>Hello to all reading. My name is Taylor and I am an aspiring coder attempting to learn as much as I can in order to make it big. The main coding languages that I am currently learning are HTML and CSS, the building blocks of this website. I am continuing my journey of learning code using the website Codecademy. This company allows me to practice my coding on my own time and at my own pace. Once I finish learning HTML and CSS I can also move on to other languages to further help my adventure into coding such as JavaScript and SQL for more of the interactivity items. My overall career goals are to be able to either do freelance jobs for people or get hired by a big company and work on their websites for them.</p>
